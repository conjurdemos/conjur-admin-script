This repo is a **Certified** level project. It's been reviewed by CyberArk to verify that it will securely
work with CyberArk Conjur Enterprise as documented. In addition, CyberArk offers Enterprise-level support for these features. For
more detailed  information on our certification levels, see [our community guidelines](https://github.com/cyberark/community/blob/master/Conjur/conventions/certification-levels.md#community).

## Requirements

Specific functions such as "Export the effective policy" requires Conjur Open Source / Enterprise 13.4 or higher.
Other functions can work with previous versions.

## Usage instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/conjurdemos/conjur-admin-script.git
cd conjur-admin-script
bash conjur_admin.sh
```
Menu Options:

1. Collect Data From Nodes

Connects to each cluster node and executes an autogenerated bash script file, checker.sh. The output is saved in conjur_checker.log. This script performs a series of checks on each node, including:

    Configuration Files:
        /etc/hosts
        /etc/hostname
        /etc/resolv.conf
        /etc/redhat-release

    System Information:
        Kernel version (uname -a)
        SELinux status
        Podman version

    System Health:
        Filesystem status
        Folder permissions
        Info endpoint
        Health endpoint

2. Cluster Consistency Check

Analyzes the conjur_checker.log file (automatically runs Collect Data From Nodes if the file is not found) and performs comparisons of key packages and configurations to ensure consistency across all nodes in the Conjur HA Cluster.

3. Export the Effective Policy

Authenticates with the Conjur API and extracts the loaded policies from the Conjur database. The policies are then organized into a folder structure on the local filesystem, mirroring the database structure.

4. Fetch Secret Values in Bulk

Fetches all secrets accessible to the currently logged-in user. Caution: The fetched secrets are displayed in plain text on the standard output. Handle with care to avoid exposing sensitive information.

5. Conjur Objects List

Authenticates with the Conjur API and generates a summary of the number of objects loaded into Conjur, including users, policies, groups, and other entities.

6. Conjur Variable Show

Provides an interactive menu listing the variables loaded into Conjur. You can choose to view metadata information about each variable or reveal the value itself.

7. Grant Read Permissions

Assigns read permissions to a predefined user, policyReader, created at the root level. This action applies to all policies in the system, ensuring that policyReader has the necessary access for auditing or other operations.
